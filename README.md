# odin-recipes

i am not a chef. i am not even a home cook. i do my best and try to keep myself alive. but i do love food, and i do prefer that the food i consume is enjoyable and doesn't make me feel like shit. but i will never take more than 20 minutes to whip something up, i just don't have it in my (although if any ladies out there want to uhaul i will gladly bond with you over some delicious and nutricious salmon dinner).

here is a brief collection of the "recipes" i repeat over and over again. they're not much, but i'm still here aren't i?

this is my first website (-:

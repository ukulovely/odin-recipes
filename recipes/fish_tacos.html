    <small><strong>disclaimer: </strong>i obviously did not make the tacos in the pic above but don't they look good???</small>
    <h4>it's salty, it's savory, it's delicious</h4>
    <p>so i love mexican food, and i love seafood. basically my two favorite foods. 
        unfortunately, i can't order mexican food OR seafood at restaurants, the former
        due to my onion intolerance an the latter my perpetual under-employment. them fishes 
        be $$$$$. so instead, i buy bulk frozen tilapia and make these yummy tacos, safe and
         cheap from the comfort of my own kitchen. 
    </p>
    <p>the really nice thing about this meal is that i almost always have the ingredients on hand. 
        i keep some sort of greens on rotation at all times (spinach, arugula, cabbage, etc.) and 
        the other ingredients are just things i use in other meals i cook regularly (shredded cheese, 
        sour cream, beans, rice, etc.). i'm not going to tally up the cents spent for ya'll but this 
        meal is C H E A P i promise you. and many ingredients are really more of suggestions, feel 
        free to ornament your fish base as the spirit moves you.
    </p>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>tilapia, 1 fillet</li>
        <li>tortillas, i like corn best but flour also works</li>
        <li>some kind of beans or rice, 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>cabbage slaw (sub any greens)</li>
        <li>mexican cheese, sprinkle</li>
        <li>sour cream, dollop</li>
        <li>cumin, a few shakes</li>
        <li>qdoba seasoning, a few shakes</li>
        <li>oregano, a bunch of shakes</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper, enough to make it a nice spicy color</li>
        <li>garlic powder, probably way too much</li>
        <li>lime juice, fresh squeezed when possible</li>
        <li>olive oil, tbsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>thaw the fish under some lukewarm water</li>
        <li>while fish is thawing, mix together the spices with some more oil</li>
        <li>start frying it up with a little olive oil in the pan</li>
        <li>slather that shit up with the spice concoction</li>
        <li>once it's pretty cooked through, chop into lil pieces to get them crispy</li>
        <li>add toppings to suit your mood</li>
        <li>ik it's not authentic but none of this is, the tortillas taste nice after 2 min in an air fryer</li>
    </ol>
    <p>i <strong>do</strong> actually eat these tacos like 
    once a week and they're pretty good. i'm not good at cooking 
    but i love fish and i love tacos. have a great day!</p>
